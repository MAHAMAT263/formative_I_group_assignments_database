# Database Design

## Project Overview
We built a complete database system that brings together both SQL and MongoDB. The goal was to design a database, set up MongoDB collections, and created a FastAPI-powered backend for seamless CRUD operations. On top of that, we developed a script to fetch and prepare data for machine learning predictions

## What We Did
- Designed and Implemented a Database: Built a well-structured relational database with at least three tables, including primary/foreign keys, stored procedures, and triggers.
- Integrated MongoDB: Created equivalent NoSQL collections to complement our relational database.
- Developed a FastAPI Backend: Implemented RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- Set Up an ML Prediction Pipeline: Retrieved the latest database entry, processed the data, and ran predictions using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## How It Works
1. The SQL database holds structured student data, while MongoDB manages complementary NoSQL records.
2. The FastAPI backend enables CRUD operations for managing data.
3. A script fetches the latest entry from the database and prepares it for ML predictions.
4. The ML model processes the data and generates predictions.
